An intelligent, agentic travel assistant that creates personalized travel plans based on your destination, budget, and trip duration. This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture where an LLM-powered agent uses live APIs as tools to gather information and reason about it.

üöÄ Core Features

This agent acts as a smart assistant that:

Accepts a destination, total budget, and trip duration as input.

Dynamically calls external APIs (tools) to retrieve real-time data for hotels and weather.

Reasons about the data to create a practical, personalized travel plan with a cost breakdown.

Provides a clear, summarized response with actionable suggestions.

Feature	Description
User Inputs	Country/City, Budget (e.g. $1000), Duration (e.g. 5 days)
RAG Retrieval	Fetches live data from hotel search APIs (Booking.com) and weather APIs.
Agentic Reasoning	Calculates a daily budget, filters affordable hotels, and summarizes weather.
Response Output	Suggests hotels, provides a cost estimate, and includes weather information.
demonstrations

Here is a sample interaction with the agent via the command-line interface.

You: I want to go to Tokyo, Japan for 5 days with a $1500 budget.

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

I need to plan a trip to Tokyo, Japan for 5 days with a total budget of $1500.

1.  **Deconstruct the Query**: Destination: Tokyo, Japan. Budget: $1500. Duration: 5 days.
2.  **Calculate Accommodation Budget**: A reasonable hotel budget is 45% of the total. Max nightly price = ($1500 * 0.45) / 5 days = $135/night.
3.  **Search for Hotels**: I will call the `find_hotels` tool with `city='Tokyo'` and `max_price=135`.
4.  **Estimate Daily Spend**: I will call the `get_daily_spend_estimate` tool for Tokyo.
5.  **Get Weather**: I will call the `get_weather_info` tool for Tokyo.
6.  **Synthesize Plan**: Combine all results into a final response.

Action: find_hotels(city='Tokyo', max_price=135)
...
Action: get_daily_spend_estimate(city='Tokyo')
...
Action: get_weather_info(city='Tokyo')
...
I have gathered all the necessary information to create a travel plan.

> Finished chain.

Agent: Here is a suggested travel plan for your trip to Tokyo based on a $1500 budget for 5 days:

*   **Budget Overview**:
    *   **Max Hotel Budget**: I have allocated approximately $135 per night for accommodation.
    *   **Estimated Daily Spend**: For food and local transport in Tokyo, a reasonable daily budget is around $60-$80.

*   **Hotel Suggestions (under $135/night)**:
    - **HOTEL MYSTAYS Ueno East** (Price: ~$125/night, Rating: 8.1/10)
    - **Sotetsu Fresa Inn Higashi Shinjuku** (Price: ~$130/night, Rating: 8.2/10)
    - **APA Hotel Asakusa Ekimae** (Price: ~$110/night, Rating: 7.9/10)

*   **Weather in Tokyo**:
    The current weather in Tokyo is: Mainly clear with a temperature of 24¬∞C.

*   **Total Estimated Cost**:
    *   Accommodation: ~$625 (for 5 nights)
    *   Food & Transport: ~$350 (at $70/day)
    *   **Total**: ~**$975**. This leaves you with a comfortable buffer in your budget for activities and shopping.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Backend Logic: Python

LLM Framework: ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain

LLM: OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo

API Server: FastAPI

Dependencies: python-dotenv, requests, uvicorn

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

An OpenAI API Key.

A RapidAPI Account and Key.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-agentic-rag.git
cd travel-agentic-rag

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set Up API Keys

You need to provide your API keys in a .env file.

Create a file named .env by copying the example file:

cp .env.example .env

Open the .env file and add your secret keys:

# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
RAPIDAPI_KEY="..."


Get Your Keys:

OpenAI: Get your key from platform.openai.com/api-keys. You may need to add billing information to your account to access GPT-4 models.

RapidAPI:

Sign up at RapidAPI.com.

Subscribe to the Booking Scraper API on the free BASIC plan.

Find your X-RapidAPI-Key on the API's "Endpoints" page.

Security Note: The .env file is included in .gitignore to prevent you from accidentally committing your secret keys to version control.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

You can run the agent in two ways: as a command-line tool for testing or as a FastAPI web server.

1. Run the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

This is the best way to quickly test the agent's functionality.

python app.py cli


You will be prompted to enter your travel query. Type exit to quit.

2. Run the FastAPI Server

This exposes the agent's logic as an API endpoint.
``bash
uvicorn app:app --reload


The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

You can send a POST request to the /plan-trip endpoint to get a travel plan.

Example with curl:

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/plan-trip' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "destination": "Rome, Italy",
  "budget": 1000,
  "duration_days": 4
}'

üß† Agent Logic Flow

The agent's "thought process" is guided by a system prompt in app.py. Here's how it handles a query:

Deconstruct User Query: It first identifies the core entities: destination, total_budget, and duration_days.

Calculate Budgets: It calculates the maximum nightly price for hotels by allocating a portion of the total budget (e.g., 45%).

Invoke Tools: Based on its plan, the agent calls the necessary tools in sequence:

find_hotels(city, max_price): Calls the Booking Scraper API.

get_weather_info(city): Calls the Open-Meteo API.

get_daily_spend_estimate(city): Calls our mock estimation tool.

Synthesize the Plan: The agent aggregates all the information gathered from the tools.

Generate Final Response: It formats the aggregated data into a user-friendly, comprehensive travel plan and presents it as the final answer.

üó∫Ô∏è Future Improvements

Integrate Real Cost of Living API: Replace the mock get_daily_spend_estimate with a real API like Numbeo for more accurate daily budgets.

Add Flight Search Tool: Incorporate a flight search API (e.g., Skyscanner) to include travel costs in the budget.

Build a Web UI: Create a simple frontend using Streamlit or React to provide a more interactive user experience.

Implement Caching: Use a simple cache (like Redis) to store API responses for popular destinations to reduce latency and API calls.

Add Conversation Memory: Allow for follow-up questions, enabling the agent to remember the context of the current conversation.
